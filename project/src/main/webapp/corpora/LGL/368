Yard waste drop-off on first Saturdays. City of Oxford residents are again being offered the opportunity to recycle yard waste at the city's Municipal Garage at 945 Collins Run Road, on the first Saturday of each month from April 4 through Jan. 2, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Residents will be able to dispose of acceptable yard waste items for recycling at no charge. Brush, branches, leaves and miscellaneous vegetative debris may be loose, contained in paper bags, or bundled with biodegradable cord. Branches and limbs are limited to eight feet in length with a diameter of four inches or less. The city is not able to accept the following items for recycling: grass clippings, sod, shrub and tree root balls with attached soil, and any solid, hazardous, household, electronic and special wastes, etc. Waste that does not meet criteria will not be accepted at the facility. Residents are required to remove yard waste from their vehicle as city staff cannot be responsible for damage to a resident's vehicle or property. This recycling opportunity is offered to Oxford residents and is not intended for use by commercial landscapers or property management companies. Identification may be required to prove city residency. City of Oxford Yard Waste Curb Side Recycling is available every week on regular refuse pickup days March through November and on the first full week of the months December through February.
