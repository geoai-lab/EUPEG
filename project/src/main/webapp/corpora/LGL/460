Woman is robbed behind Berea apartment complex. Berea police are searching for a suspect in a March 21 robbery, but have only a limited description to go on. Berea Police Department spokesman Capt. Ken Clark said the victim in the robbery outside an apartment complex in the 800 block of Candlewood Drive could provide only a partial description. “We don’t have much to go on,” Clark said. The woman described the man who shoved her to the ground and stole her purse as a tall, large male wearing a dark or gray hooded sweatshirt, Clark said. The man fled the scene as a passenger in a green car. Clark said the woman was outside smoking behind the complex when the suspect pushed her to the ground, causing cuts to her knees and hands. “That’s why we made it a robbery first (degree), because the statute says if someone’s injured,” Clark said.
