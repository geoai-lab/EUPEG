The boys of summer. Editor's note: Linda Wuebben, a correspondent for the Daily News, grew up as part of the Bernard Becker family of baseball enthusiasts in Cedar County. This story reflects her love for baseball and its impact on her family. * * *It's the crack of the bat, the roar of the crowd. Baseball season is just around the corner. Springtime brings warm weather, new flowers and baseball. Only true baseball fans think this way and I can attest to being one of them. At a very young age, I already knew baseball was special and important to my family. Many times baseball was the talk around our dinner table and when the new Minnesota Twins baseball franchise first had its game broadcast on the radio in 1960, my dad listened almost religiously. Farm work could wait a few hours. As I grew older, the family baseball tales were imprinted on my brain. My dad played the game and remembered the greats like Babe Ruth - idols for all the players who dreamed of glory while playing town team baseball. Baseball here in Cedar County goes back more than 100 years and still has dedicated players and fans. It was a regular source of entertainment, and a source of bragging rights for years to come. A few years ago, I wrote a story about local Cedar County town baseball, "The Boys of Summer" for the Daily News. Much to my surprise, I was subsequently contacted by Rick Baxter, president of the Nebraska State Baseball Association, who had read the article. From him, I learned about the Nebraska Baseball Hall of Fame and its Web site. A year ago, I decided what a wonderful tribute it would be to my father's family to submit their names for consideration. Last fall, I was notified - they were in. Just on Sunday, we accepted a medal of honor for the Bernard Becker family, and no one was probably prouder than my brother and I.I'm sure my dad and uncles were standing right there beside us. I could feel their baseball spirit gently whispering in our midst. "Let's play ball."
