Houses not selling despite low prices. BY KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK -- The recent reported surge in home sales nationally has not yet reached Licking County, according to Licking County property transfer records provided by the county. The number of sales through March 15 dropped from 493 in 2008 to 309 this year, a 37 percent decline. The average sale price fell from $122,492 in 2008 to $110,416 so far in 2009, an almost 10 percent decrease. Jackie Lewis, president of the Licking County Board of Realtors, said she has seen signs better times are ahead, but buyers remain cautious. "I can truly say people are out looking, but they're still hesitant to make up their minds because so many homes are sitting bank-owned," Lewis said. "In warmer weather, people start to look." The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes increased 5.1 percent in February compared to January, the largest monthly sales jump since July 2003. But local sales were virtually unchanged from January to February, according to the local board of Realtors. In the three Licking County cities of Newark, Heath and Pataskala, the sales through March 15 dropped from a combined 251 last year to 155 this year, a 38 percent tumble. Lewis predicts a surge not only because residents traditionally look more seriously in the spring, but also because of investors facing a tax deadline. They want to buy, Lewis said, because they have money they don't want taxed. The Licking County Board of Realtors reports home sales through its Multiple Listing Service fell during the first two months of the year, from 151 in 2008 to 114 this year, a 25 percent decline. Prices also dropped by 11 percent. Still, she thinks the deals are just too good for people to pass up much longer, and the increased sales elsewhere will begin to show up here. "We see this in anything," Lewis said. "It always hits the West Coast first and comes our way. Why? I have no idea. It's all about educating our buyers." Nathan Gill, a mortgage banker with American Eagle Mortgage Corp., said he has fielded an increase in phone calls requesting loan applications, mostly from first-time homebuyers. The reason for the increased interest, he said, probably is the federal tax credit available through Nov. 30. The refundable tax credit, on 2009 taxes filed in 2010, is for 10 percent of the sale price up to $8,000. "I think the word is finally getting out," Gill said. "We're trying to let people know there are advantages to purchasing homes right now. "The tax credit, I believe, will have an effect this year. People have got to take advantage of it now." The Ohio Housing Finance Agency's Homebuyer Tax Credit Advantage Program, which starts March 30, allows homebuyers to use up to 3 percent of the purchase price for the down payment. They don't have to pay the loan back until July 1, 2010, he said Interest rates, Gill said, were available Friday at about 4.75 percent, compared to 8 percent in 2000, when homes were selling in large numbers.
