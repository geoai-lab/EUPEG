State lawmakers say cigarette tax hike likely. COLUMBIA -- The sometimes-fierce nine-year battle over raising South Carolina's lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax could end quietly this month. S.C. House Republicans and Democrats think they have a plan both sides can support to increase the tax. The plan is modeled after an Oklahoma program that uses cigarette tax revenue to secure matching federal money. That federal money then is used to provide a subsidy to buy health insurance for low-income residents or small businesses that could not afford insurance. “It looked like Oklahoma found a way to include the federal match,” said House Speaker Bobby Harrell, the plan's author. “That is critical to making sure there is enough money in the fund to cover a large number of uninsured people.” Last year, the House and Senate approved a 50-cent-a-pack increase. But disagreement over how the money would be spent meant the House could not override Gov. Mark Sanford's veto. If approved by the federal government, the House plan would raise the state cigarette tax by 50 cents a pack, raising about $147 million. That money, matched about 2-for-1 with federal Medicaid money, would provide tax credits to employers worth about 75 percent of the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. "This is a compromise between people who want something tax-neutral and those folks who want to expand Medicaid," Harrell said. Additionally, about $5 million a year would pay for efforts to help people quit smoking. The state currently provides no money to help pay for smoking-cessation efforts.
