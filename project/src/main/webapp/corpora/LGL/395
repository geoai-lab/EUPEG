Suspects identified in fatal hit-and-run. A Crime Stoppers tip provided the break investigators needed to make an arrest in the hit-and-run death of Terry A. Corbin. “Right now, we are in the process of drawing up arrest warrants for two persons,” Detective Jeff Goodwin of the Paris Police Department said shortly before 1 p.m. Tuesday. Goodwin said a Crime Stoppers tip led investigators to Ashley L. Evens, 26, of rural Paris and Guy C. Harminson, 26, also of rural Paris as suspects in the case. “We’ve been looking at them since March 14th,” said Goodwin. The detective added police believe the evidence gathered in the case will show that Evens was driving a 1996 Dodge pickup that struck Corbin at 1:33 a.m. on Dec. 6, 2008. Paris police and fire departments and the Edgar County Special Service Area Ambulance responded to the early morning call on Dec. 6 and found Corbin in the southbound lane of state Route 1 at the Marshall Street cutoff. He was first transported to Paris Community Hospital and subsequently airlifted to Carle Foundation Hospital, Urbana, where he succumbed to his injuries at 10:22 a.m. The warrant for Evens charges her with a Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of an accident involving a death and driving while license suspended. Harminson is being arrested on a Class 4 felony of obstructing justice. A check of Edgar County Court records through the judici website reveals that Evens has a prior speeding conviction in Edgar County. Harminson’s name does not appear in the records. Goodwin confirmed that both Evens and Harminson were interviewed by the police as part of the investigation, and he anticipated them surrendering on the warrants later Tuesday afternoon.
