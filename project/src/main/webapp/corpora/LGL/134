Lexington 4 to raise taxes, cut staff. Lexington 4’s proposed 2009-10 spending plan will include reductions in the overall budget and staff, the result of declining revenue and enrollment in the upcoming academic year. Superintendent Linda Hawkins outlined a $21.8 million spending plan Monday, a $1.2 million reduction over the current level — even with a property tax increase to make up for having less state aid. The proposed tax hike — the maximum allowed — amounts to an extra $57 yearly for the owner of a home valued at $100,000. The financial picture is “the worst I’ve ever seen,” Hawkins said. The spending plan submitted to the school board calls for a staff reduction of nearly 18 — 14 teachers and four others, with some going to part time. The district now has 457 employees. More than half of the teachers eliminated are retirees who had come back to the classroom. The staff cuts reflect an expected enrollment decline of nearly 100 students, to 3,200, in the Gaston and Swansea area schools. “We are looking at every possible thing we could cut, working smarter,” Hawkins said. Hawkins wants to avoid staff furloughs. “That is an option we don’t want to do. If things get much worse, we may have to.” The seven-member board is waiting until May to see whether revenue forecasts improve or worsen before acting on the plan. The cuts reflect “dire times,” board chairwoman Sheila Parkman said. “You’ve made some good choices,” Lawrence Livingston said of the plan.
