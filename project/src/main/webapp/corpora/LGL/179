Celebrating Frank Buck's 125th birthday. Frank Buck Zoo is inviting all of its friends, new and old, to join them in celebrating Frank “Bring ‘Em Back Alive” Buck’s birthday on March 17. Frank Howard Buck was born in Gainesville on March 17, 1884. As a child Buck was fascinated by all kinds of animals and loved to study school geography books filled with exotic names of far-off places, said Frank Buck Zoo Director Susan Kleven in an e-mail sent to the Register. In 1911, she added, Buck began his 24 year career in the business of collecting animals for exhibit. “At a time when ‘big game hunting’ abroad was a popular pastime of the wealthy, Frank Buck concentrated on capturing and preserving the world’s wildlife,” said Kleven. “Buck abhorred the senseless slaughter of animals. His efforts play a large role in making American’s aware of how important it is to conserve the vast treasure that is our native wildlife. ”“During his career, Buck placed many animals into environments in which they could breed and propagate without the threat of extinction. Thus, Frank Buck was one of the first wildlife conservationist at a time when conservation was a sadly neglected matter.” In honor of Buck’s birthday, zoo admission will be a buck a head ($1) during Tuesday, March 17 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.Visitors will also be able to explore the world’s only Frank Buck Exhibit located in the zoo’s gift shop. Cake will also be available while it lasts. Frank Buck Zoo is located at 1000 W. California Street. For more information, please call 668-4539 or visit the online website at www.frankbuckzoo.com.
