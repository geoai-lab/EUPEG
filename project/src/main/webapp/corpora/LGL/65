City schools look at alternative calendar. Building capacity can be maximized through having balanced calendars. Rigell said students could be split into groups, with different groups being in class at different times - for example, three groups can be in session at one time while one group is on vacation. If overcrowding became a major issue, Rigell said this could solve it in a more cost-effective manner than adding to an existing school or building a new one. Rigell said he would poll other school systems that currently have balanced calendars to see how they have implemented them. He will also poll systems that have had balanced calendars in the past and dropped them to see what shortcomings they found. That information will be presented to the Board as it is collected. Bevins said he could check with McMinn County School Board Chairwoman Pat Chester to see if the county has interest in exploring an alternative calendar. More than 10 years ago, a task force was appointed from among the county's three public school systems - Athens, McMinn County and Etowah - to study that possibility but no changes resulted.
