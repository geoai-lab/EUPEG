Man accused of threatening tax worker . ST. PAUL -- No matter how frustrating taxes get, it's not a good idea to threaten to do a drive-by shooting at the state Department of Revenue. Authorities have charged a South St. Paul man with two counts of terroristic threats after he got upset and allegedly told a Department of Revenue supervisor he was going to do a drive-by shooting. According to the complaint filed in Ramsey District Court, a Revenue Department supervisor said Stephen Eugene Morris, 55, told her in a phone call, "Maybe I will just do a (expletive) drive-by." Morris told the St. Paul Pioneer Press he actually told the supervisor he just felt like doing a drive-by. He said there was no mention of shooting. He says the dispute was over $181.44 in sales taxes he believes was wrongfully charged to his custom pool cue business.
