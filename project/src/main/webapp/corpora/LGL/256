An overview of the stateIndiana’s unemployment rate grew slightly in February to 9.4 percent, keeping the state’s jobless rate at the highest level since the recession of the early 1980s. February’s jobless report shows 324,000 Indiana residents looking for work — about 4,000 more than in January. That pushed the state’s jobless rate up slightly from January’s 9.3 percent. February’s numbers suggest that an increase in heavy construction jobs amid the lingering recession is starting to offset continued drops in auto manufacturing, said Teresa Voors, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. “We expect to see continued growth as outdoor construction resumes, but this may not completely negate extended furloughs and layoffs in the automobile industry in the coming months,” Voors said.
