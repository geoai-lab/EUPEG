Residents escape fire at Northland apartments . A neighbor was banging on the door of their North Kansas City apartment, alerting them that the adjacent building was on fire. The two-alarm blaze at the Sunny Hills Apartments & Town Homes was reported just after 9 a.m. as a deck fire in the 1600 block of Northeast Club House Drive. By the time firefighters arrived, one building with about eight units was engulfed in flame. Rose, 28, his 2 1/2-year-old son and his fiancee made it safely outside. “If it wasn’t for my neighbor, I probably would have died of smoke inhalation,” said Rose, who works the overnight shift at a Northland packing facility. “I have to be around for my son,” he said. The wind-fanned fire quickly spread to the second apartment building, where Rose lived. Fire crews from North Kansas City and Kansas City used aerial hoses to pour water on the blaze. The thick, black smoke was visible for miles along Interstate 35. Fire officials did not know how many residents were displaced. Investigators are expected to spend today picking through debris to determine how the fire started. The high winds made for difficult work for the fire crews, said North Kansas City Fire Marshal David Dollins. Two firefighters reported minor injuries, but fire officials knew of no injuries among residents.
