Alan, 79, strikes out in marathon. VETERAN swimmer Alan Wood is planning to give himself a very special birthday present - the completion of a marathon. Alan, 79, from Barton, is attempting to clock up 26 miles in the pool at Cambridge's Chesterton sports centre, swimming three miles a session over a number of weeks. He aims to finish the last mile on his 80th birthday, in a few days' time. He said: "I'm the leader of the Cambridge group of the Macular Disease Society, and I'm doing the swimming marathon to raise money for the society's work. "I'm trying to do three miles a week, about 100 lengths a session, and I've managed to do 14 miles so far," Mr Wood said. "I will be 80 in April, and my plan is to do the last part of the swim on my birthday, as a way to celebrate." The Macular Disease Society was set up to help sufferers of macular degeneration. This is the collective term for more than 1,500 conditions which affect central vision by damage to the macula, a small area of the retina at the back of the eye. It is estimated there are more than 500,000 people with macular conditions in the UK. Mr Wood said: "There's a constant need for funding for research to help people, and that's why I'm doing the swim. I don't know yet how much I'll raise, but I hope people will sponsor me. I have had a number of offers of sponsorship already. "I'm finding the swimming all right at the moment, and I'm confident I'll get over the finish line." If anyone wants to sponsor Mr Wood's effort, they can do so by ringing him on Cambridge (01223) 264970, or emailing afbwood@uwclub.net .
