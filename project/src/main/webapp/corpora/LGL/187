Man with sack charged with burglary. A man toting an accessory normally used by Santa Claus caught the attention of deputies Saturday afternoon. Kijuan D. McDonald was hauling around a bulging white sack at 4:40 p.m. in the Holly Heights neighborhood of Gainesville. “That got our attention,” said Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Art Forgey. While deputies chatted with McDonald, 24, of Archer, about the contents of the bag  mostly electronics - other deputies were checking out a report of a burglary involving mostly electronics from a unit in the nearby Sparrow Condominiums at 601 SW 75th St. The discussion with McDonald led them to an apartment at 6813 SW 4th Place that had been leased to Barry M. George, 46. A few items found at George’s apartment and the items in the white bag McDonald had been carrying matched the descriptions of the items taken from the condominium. McDonald and Barry were charged with burglary of an unoccupied dwelling and theft. Barry was also charged with two unrelated counts of failing to appear in court on previous case.
