Man booked for teen assault. The Athens Police Department arrested a 33-year-old man Monday on a charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child — in this case, a teen-age girl. Julius Anton Givens was arraigned at the Henderson County Jail Tuesday morning, with bond set at $50,000 on the sexual assault charge and $2,000 on a charge of theft of property. Athens Police Department reports state Sgt. Brett Morman, Officers Ron McCurry and Chad Walker and Investigator Bill Carlow were dispatched at 1:24 p.m. to a residence where Givens had been located. Detective Sgt. Don Yarbrough said Givens was arrested without incident. Yarbrough said the victim of the assault was a female, and that the charge stemmed from a February 28 incident. On March 9, APD received a call from a family member reporting the teen-age girl had been assaulted. The case was turned over to Carlow who spoke with family members and the victim. Yarbrough said few details of the alleged sexual assault could be released due to the ongoing investigation and the nature of the offense.
