Jordan Junior Olympic volleyball starts again. The Jordan Junior Olympic volleyball program is starting up again for 2008, and will be offering two spring volleyball programs again this year. Option one is for the United States Volleyball Association program’s 12-1, 13-1, and 14-1 traveling teams. Players will need to try-out for the advanced level of play. There will be one team at each level with eight to 10 players per team. The season runs from March until June. It takes a USVBA membership and involves six tournaments for a cost of $300. Tryouts will be for the 12-1 (sixth-grade), 13-1 (seventh-grade), and 14-1 (eighth-grade) teams on the following dates at the Jordan middle school. The first will be from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday, Feb. 18, followed by tryouts from 3:15 to 5:15 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 20, Friday, Feb. 22, and Monday, Feb. 25. Any player that does not make the 1's teams will automatically be put on a team in Jordan league play. To play in this league, presence is not necessary at the above tryouts. Schedules for practices will be handed out the end of February. For more information, contact Jordan Juniors coordinator Colleen Chambers at 952-873-6325 or 952-240-3072.
