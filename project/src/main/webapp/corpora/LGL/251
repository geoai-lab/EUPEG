CFBC presents ‘gift of green’. More than $133,000 was distributed to 40 service agencies and organizations Tuesday at the Community Foundation of Boone County’s annual Circle of Giving Breakfast. “We greatly appreciate all of the work that you do,” said CFBC chairman Tom Easterday before coaxing representatives of 21 groups attending the event into applauding themselves. Easterday termed the event, “the giving of the green on St. Patrick’s Day.” The presentation was of “dedicated” funds — money from specific endowments supervised by the CFBC for specific organizations. “The foundation exists to bring people who care together with causes that matter,” Easterday said. He said the breakfast was “a prime example of the synergy” between donors and needs in Boone County. “If we can continue to match up donors with items of concern to them ... we can do this for many, many years,” Easterday said. Public schools were the biggest beneficiaries Tuesday. The Zionsville Education Foundation, established in 1995 by the Glassier Memorial Fund and the ZEF’s founders, received $26,217. The Western Boone Education Foundation received $23,101 from a fund created in 2000 by its board of directors.
