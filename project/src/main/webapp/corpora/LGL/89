 They did so at a special meeting recently, at the request of First Selectman Jeremy J. Shingleton. Shingleton explained that he hoped to piggyback the purchase of the bathroom with a similar project in another town — Oakdale — thereby reducing the overall cost. In all, Shingleton told the board, he expects the bathroom to cost $47,837. Director of Public Works Eric Hood said the town is purchasing the prefabricated bathroom from United Concrete Products of Wallingford. "We’re trying to keep it in state," he told the selectmen. The bathroom will contain one men’s bathroom and one women’s bathroom and a storage closet in between, Hood said. Construction of the park has been a priority since Shingleton took office in November 2007. In addition to installing the restrooms, Shingleton told the selectmen crews still must complete installation of a series of trails and bocce courts at the park. That, he said, will complete the first phase of the park construction. That will be followed by a second phase, which includes installation of a pavilion. "Once we have the pavilion in place, we have a park," he said. And when the work is completed, "That will be a great picnic area," Shingleton added. But, he acknowledged, without the restrooms, picnickers "can’t stay there for a long time. "Sylvester, the finance director, said town policy allows bid waivers if state or federal contract awards are being used or if the town is participating in a multi-town purchasing arrangement. Shingleton sought the waiver to take advantage of "bid pricing obtained by another town," Sylvester explained.
