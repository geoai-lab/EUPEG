Low emission car pilot launched by Richmond Council. Council staff will be driving environmentally friendly vehicles when they are out on business after a new scheme was launched this week. The cars will run on bio-fuel - recycled cooking oil - and it is hoped the move will cut costs as well as reducing carbon emissions. If the pilot scheme - believed to be a national first - is successful it will be rolled out and staff will no longer need to use their own cars for work. Councillor David Trigg, cabinet member for traffic, transport and parking, said it was part of the authority’s vision for a sustainable and integrated travel plan. "The use of bio-fuel from used cooking oil adds extra value. The council runs its current fleet of vehicles on this fuel and this is a natural progression. “The message is clear - fundamental changes in the way we use private, shared and public transport are needed in order to fulfil the need to cut carbon emissions and tackle global warming. It's infinitely better to tackle the issues while we still have a choice. “Under the proposed scheme one pool car will provide transport for up to eight council officers, making a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion.”
