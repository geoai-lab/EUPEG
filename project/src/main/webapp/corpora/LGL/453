Belk Foundation gives $5,000 to women’s shelter. The Belk Foundation announced Wednesday a $5,000 grant to Hope’s Wings in Richmond to help fund general operating costs for the shelter. “Hope’s Wings is a shelter committed to providing women and children who are victims of domestic abuse a safe haven,” said Katie Belk Morris, president of The Belk Foundation. “We are honored to help Hope’s Wings provide food and shelter to victims in the city of Richmond.” Hope’s Wings is committed to providing a safe environment as well as outreach services for victims of domestic violence and their children. The shelter includes around the clock staff members to monitor safety along with housing, food, clothing and basic needs. Outreach services include parenting education, support groups, counseling, legal and medical advocacy and transportation in an effort to provide support within the community. “Hope’s Wings is delighted to be the recipient of The Belk Foundation’s $5,000 New Community Initiative grant,” said Robyn Moreland, executive director of Hope’s Wings. “In tough economic times every dollar makes a difference. These funds allow us to do the work our community has such a need for.” Hope’s Wings was founded in 2006 by a group of committed community members who identified a need for domestic violence services in Madison County. The organization quickly went from a vision to a reality with the building of a 16 bed emergency shelter. The shelter opened in February 2009 and is already at 75 percent capacity. Hope’s Wings is a nonprofit organization that depends entirely on grants, donations and fundraising efforts. The mission of The Belk Foundation is to support deserving educational, religious, cultural, social, health and human services causes and organizations located in the communities where Belk associates live and work, in the states where the Belk stores are located. Belk opened a new store in Richmond this week.
