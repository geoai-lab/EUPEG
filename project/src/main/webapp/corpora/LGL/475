Drowning victim identified. Police have identified the man who died in a sailing accident in the waters off Steveston March 16. Ronald Young, 56, died of drowning, the coroner has confirmed. Canadian Coast Guard's Dan Bate said a passing boater spotted a mast sticking out of the water shortly after 10 a.m. and a tugboat was dispatched to the scene and confirmed the presence of a sunken sailboat. The Canadian Coast Guard hovercraft Penac and a Cormorant helicopter were dispatched to the scene, and around 6:30 p.m. a body was found in the water. Bate said the body's proximity to the boat and the timing led searchers to conclude the two were linked. The eight-metre boat, the Apaleema, was found a couple of miles from Steveston Harbour, and the body was found about a mile from the boat. Foul play isn't suspected and there's no indication that there were any other victims of the boating mishap. The sailboat is not believed to have belonged to the victim, but was apparently loaned to him by a friend.
