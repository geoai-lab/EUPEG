Shingleton planning to run for re-election. CROMWELL — The third Democrat to enter the race for first selectman, Jeremy J. Shingleton, has announced his intention to run for re-election. He joins two candidates: finance board member John Flanders and Police Chief Anthony J. Salvatore, who have each said they plan to run. No Republicans have announced plans to run in the November election. Shingleton opened up his campaign headquarters over the weekend at 319 Main St., where volunteers spent Saturday cleaning and painting. “As part of our downtown revitalization project, we are trying to bring as many people downtown as possible, so I thought a good way to do that is to set up campaign headquarters,” Shingleton said.
