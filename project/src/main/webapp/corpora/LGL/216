Police found 259 bags of heroin, 10 grams of marijuana and $4,388 in cash. They also found a stolen 9mm handgun and numerous rounds of ammunition. Four people, all of whom live at 44 Hungerford St., were arrested on drug and other charges: Kenneth Bonilla, 23; Edwin Luciano, 18; Enrique Luciano, 22; and Jose Luciano, 20.
