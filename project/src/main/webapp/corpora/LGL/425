Mayor's budget won't boost taxes. Susan Vela svela@lsj.com March 24, 2009 From Lansing State Journal The Lansing City Council will host several public hearings to consider the mayor's proposed $117.3 million general fund budget for 2009-10. A schedule was not available Monday. The $5.5 million gap between projected revenues and expenses, Finance Director Jerry Ambrose said, could be shrunk in this fashion: $1.853 million by eliminating 40 positions. $1.377 million by moving money once set aside for debt payment to the operating fund. $1 million by reducing the prefunding for retiree health care. $500,000 from fines for a new motor carrier weight enforcement program. $412,000 from increased ambulance service fees paid for by insurance companies. $350,000 from grant funding for law enforcers. $25,000 in 54-A District Court reimbursements.
