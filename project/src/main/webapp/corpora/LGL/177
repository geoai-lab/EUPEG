Former Hall County official named to Forsyth County post. The board voted 5-0 tonight to remove the "interim" tag from County Manager Doug Derrer's title. The decision was not unexpected. Two weeks ago, the board named Derrer as the sole finalist for the position. A 14-day period of review followed the announcement, in which the public could comment on Derrer's selection. Derrer is the fifth person to hold the spot since 2004. The position pays the same as his interim post, $130,000 per year, with a one-year severance should he leave. Derrer's job does not fall under the protection of the civil service board, a three-member panel that determines employee appeals. One added benefit to Derrer's contract as county manager is that the county will pay 100 percent of his health insurance. His government experience runs deep. A veteran of Hall County government, he retired in December 2007 after more than 25 years of service. He opted to take early retirement from Hall, but felt he "still had a lot of energy left, and I feel like I still have a lot to offer the community." Months after retiring from Hall, he joined Forsyth as deputy county manager. He was elevated to the interim county manager spot after Rhonda Poston-O'Connor was fired as county manager in September 2008.
