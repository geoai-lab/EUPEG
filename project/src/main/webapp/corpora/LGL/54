Vandals striking local businesses. Costly acts of mischief have been happening around city businesses, roadways over last several months The Athens Police Department is asking for the public’s help in finding those responsible for painting graffiti on various buildings and structures around the city. The most recent cases of criminal mischief were reported Tuesday morning. During the night, someone spraypainted Dunn’s Automotive and Norman’s Welding on West Tyler Street. Symbols and obscenities had also been painted on the concrete portion of the railroad overpass on West Corsicana Street, APD reports state. “It appears to be a small group of kids that’s going around spraypainting on the buildings,” Detective Sgt. Don Yarbrough said. “It’s really a nuisance. People have to paint over it and it’s done several thousand dollars damage.” Most of the occurrences have been in the north and west portions of the city, Yarbrough said. Often the painting involves gang symbols. The cases of mischief have been more abundant over the past two months. “They’ve hit buildings, storage building places, sidewalks,” Yarbrough said. “They’ve done a little bit of everything. We believe they’re doing it late at night.” The property owners usually discover the damage the following morning and are unable to offer a description of the individuals. “So far we have no idea who it is. We hope if someone sees them doing it they’ll give us a call,” Yarbrough said. Anyone with information that leads to the arrest of the vandals can contact Henderson County Crimestoppers at 903-675-8477. Callers can remain anonymous. Yarbrough said anyone with information may also call him at the Athens Police Department at 903-675-5454.
