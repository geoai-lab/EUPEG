Poisoned liquor, locally known as changaa, killed seventeen and blinded a dozen in Kenya's largest slum. Many of the people who died were found in their homes, in Nairobi slum Kibera. Police said the changaa "may have contained traces of methanol", BBC News reported. The woman who distilled the liquor was arrested. Authorities are investigating if the addition of poison was accidental or not. Changaa is often supplemented with additives that make it more potent. Many Kenyans die from poisoned liquor every year, often sold in the brewer's home.
