The two cases in Poland were discovered in the northern town of Toruń, famous as the birthplace of Nicolaus Copernicus. Two swans have been confirmed to have been carriers of the virus. Samples from the subjects have been sent to the European Union (EU) laboratories in Weybridge, England, but initial assessments have been seen as highly reliable. "Yes, we have confirmed that it is definitely H5N1," said Jan Zmudzinski, director of Poland's national laboratory, in the town of Pulawy. A hygiene-security zone protected by police has been established, extending up to several hundred metres from the spot on the river bank of the Vistula river where the swans were found. Boud, a resident of Toruń, told Wikinews that he has observed authorities putting precautionary measures in place to attempt to slow the spread of bird flu.
