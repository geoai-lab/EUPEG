Torrential monsoon rains for the past 11 days have inundated parts of southeast Asia, heavily flooding areas of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh and affecting over 20 million people. An estimated 1,400 have been killed across the region, as waterborne diseases have proliferated and become highly virulent in the humid and wet conditions. The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, is currently providing relief to affected areas. In the Northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, as many as 12.5 million people have been displaced or affected by flooding. Clashes with police in Bihar have left 20 villagers injured and one man dead, since many are staging protests after being forced from their homes. UNICEF estimates as many as 1,103 may have died in 138 districts throughout northern India. Hospitals are reaching dangerous volumes as disease is sickening thousands. Many are ill from dehydration, exposure and dysentery. Aid workers warn that malaria is a serious risk. The Indian Air Force began dropping aid packages containing medical supplies and food yesterday. Santosh Mishra, a villager in the Gondra district of Uttar Pradesh remarked, "I have not seen such flooding in the last 24 years." Bodies of two students of the IIM Indore swept in the flash floods in Indore were recovered.
