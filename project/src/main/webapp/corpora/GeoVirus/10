Canada's Broadcasting Corporation reports that a case of avian flu has been discovered in a bird in the Eastern province of Prince Edward Island. The case was discovered in a gosling found in the community of O'Leary and confirmed at the Atlantic Veterinary College in Charlottetown. The announcement was made in a press release issued by the government of Prince Edward Island. Chief Health Officer for PEI, Dr. Lamont Sweet, said, "From the information we have received, there is a low risk of human illness at the present time." He went on to suggest that people in West Prince who have contact with domestic or wild birds who may be experiencing flu-like symptoms should consult their physician.
