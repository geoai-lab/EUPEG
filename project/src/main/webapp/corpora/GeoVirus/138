After testing positive for salmonella, a California produce company has recalled fresh bagged spinach from the United States and Canada. Food officials state there have been no immediate reports of illness linked to the tainted spinach that was distributed by Metz Fresh LLC. In Canada, the product only reached the distribution level and thus was not shipped to retail outlets, said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Food officials state the recalled spinach was distributed throughout the 48 states and sold in both retail and food service packages. The recall covers covers 8,118 cases of spinach, however, more than 90 per cent of that was on hold and would not be released, said Metz Fresh. Only a single sample from one of three packing lines tested positive for salmonella, but the company choose to recall all the spinach produced that day as precaution. The recall includes the following: 10 and 16 ounce bags, as well as 4 pound cartons and cartons that contain four 2.5 pound bags, with the following tracking codes: 12208114, 12208214 and 12208314. Anyone with questions about the recall, and whether or not their spinach may be recalled can contact Metz Fresh LLC  by calling (831) 386-1018.
