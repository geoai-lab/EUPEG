New outbreaks of H5N2 have been confirmed in Taiwan. Lujhu is a rural township in northwestern Taoyuan. It is located at kilometer 49 of the Highway no.1, close to the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (IATA: TPE). Kaohsiung is a county in southern Taiwan administered as a county of Taiwan. Mr Huang Kwo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, however, said, "we took the most stringent measures in dealing with the episode as according to the rules of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), there was no need to slaughter those chickens."
