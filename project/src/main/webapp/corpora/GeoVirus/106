Pope John Paul II left Rome's Gemelli hospital today, having been treated for throat spasms brought on by flu. The 84-year-old Pontiff had been in hospital for 10 days. Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said that the Pope had been "cured" from the breathing difficulties, which lead to his hospitalization. Navarro-Valls also said that the Pontiff had undergone a number of tests, including a CAT scan, which had ruled out any new illnesses. The Vatican reports that the Pope has recovered his voice and that he will make his regular appearance for crowds in St. Peter's Square. The Vatican is also being quiet regarding speculation as to the Pope's successor, the BBC reports. The Pope's last appearance was from his hospital window on Sunday (6th February).
