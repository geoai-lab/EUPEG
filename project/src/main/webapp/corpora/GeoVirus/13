1,000 turkeys in the United Kingdom have been confirmed by UK government officials as dying of a strain of avian flu and a further 1,600 have died since the infection was initially reported. The birds, believed to be from a Bernard Matthews owned farm in Suffolk fell ill and died this week after contracting the H5 strain of the flu. It is likely that all other poultry on the farm will be culled. The department were swift in carrying out a full investigation and sent samples to be tested at facilities in Weybridge. This report comes less than a year after a mass culling of 50,000 birds in Norfolk after an outbreak of the H7 strain.
