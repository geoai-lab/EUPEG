Police have released footage of a violent, late-night street fight between armed attackers in North London.
Seven men were convicted over the brawl that took place on a deserted street in Upper Edmonton on 25 February last year.
Two groups of young men can be seen confronting each other with weapons to settle a disagreement over money.
Hayder Bozkina, 20, accompanied by Bartek Glowacki, 21, confronted Rekan Saver, 20, before blows were exchanged with a group of men supporting Saver.
As Bozkina and Glowacki threaten the group, they eventually try to flee in their car, which causes the large group to attack the vehicle.
The group smash the car windows and attack the pair within the vehicle as it tries to get away, smashing into other vehicles parked on the street.
Bozkina and Glowacki were jailed for affray and possession of an offensive weapon, while Saver was imprisoned for affray and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.
Other participants included Mohamed Abdi, 21, who was detained under the Mental Health Act after appearing at Wood Green Crown Court charged with affray.
Meanwhile, Mahir Kilic, 27, and Mahmood Abubakr, 18, were sentenced for affray.
Detective Constable Rob Jones said: "CCTV footage shows that all those convicted armed themselves with weapons during this confrontation.
"The level of violence used was excessive and it is only by sheer luck that no person died as a result.
"All six males showed a complete disregard for the safety of themselves and anyone else who may have been passing by as they fought.
"Violence of this nature will not be tolerated by police - we will identify, arrest and put before the courts those who choose to take this path."
