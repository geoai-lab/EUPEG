Hours after medical workers', strike began on Monday, 61 patients from the country's largest mental
            facility escaped the hospital grounds, climbing an exterior wall and wandering across the Kenyan capital.
"After giving treatment and going to the other wards the patients were left unattended and they climbed the wall and wandered away from the hospital," said Julius Ogato, Medical Superintendent of Mathari National Teaching and Referral Hospital.
More than 24 hours later, just five of the missing patients had been found.
A video shared by a local newspaper shows the time of escape as some patients casually walk, and others run away in their hospital clothing. The facility held more than 750 patients at the time and only five nurses out of 195 person nursing staff had showed up to work that day.
As the strike continued across the country, patients have been turned away from treatment.
The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPPDU) says the strike is intended to push for the government to implement a collective bargaining commitment signed three years ago, which advocates for increased doctor hires and better pay.
