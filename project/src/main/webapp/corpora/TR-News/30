Winter is making its presence known across Canada this weekend, with many areas of the country under extreme cold or snowfall warnings.
            In B.C., up to 20 centimetres of snow is expected for parts of the Central Coast in the coming days, with 10 to 15 centimetres expected along much of the south West Coast and inland areas.
            Homeless advocates all over the province urged officials to provide more help, from blankets to warming shelters.
            And cold temperatures have frozen ponds and lakes in the Vancouver area that have not seen skaters in years.
            Poor conditions caused over 200 flights to be cancelled at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, while Ottawa's Macdonald-Cartier International Airport had 41 delays and cancellations and Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport had 88.
            Environment Canada now says snowfall in Toronto has "tapered off to light and intermittent," but warns of freezing drizzle or ice pellets into the night. Drivers in the city are also being warned of poor road conditions as ice could build up due to the mix of precipitation.
