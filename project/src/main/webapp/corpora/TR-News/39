Since meeting Aleppo Mayor Brita Hagi Hasan in Paris on December 5, Hidalgo has helped raise awareness of those in the affected part of the besieged city.
            She sent a letter sent to the Pope asking him to intervene in favor of a peaceful solution in Syria, hung a
            banner on the façade of the Paris
            Town Hall to show Parisians' solidarity and wrote a letter to the World Congress of Mayors (UCLG) to enlist
            their support.
            On Wednesday, the ceasefire brokered by Turkey with Russia for eastern Aleppo collapsed less than a day
            after it was implemented,
            as Turkey and activists on the ground accused the regime and other forces of heavy shelling and bombardment.
            Deaths were reported on both sides Wednesday, while some 50,000 civilians -- low on food and medical
            supplies -- were believed to remain
            inside the small pocket of eastern Aleppo still under rebel control.
            The ceasefire was aimed at evacuating both rebels and civilians, but by late afternoon the promised
            evacuations had not taken place.
            "While the reasons for the breakdown in the ceasefire are disputed, the resumption of extremely heavy
            bombardment by the Syrian government
            forces and their allies on an area packed with civilians is almost certainly a violation of international
            law and most likely constitutes war crimes," he said in a statement.
