Mason charged with sex assault. BANTAM — A Danbury stonework mason was arraigned in Bantam Superior Court Tuesday on charges he sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl over six years ago. Rafael Gomez, 27, 69 Wooster St., stood before Judge Corinne Klatt for his first court appearance in a case that first came to the attention of the New Milford Police Department in July 2002. Gomez, a native of Mexico, was arrested by Danbury police on Monday night and brought to New Milford
        authorities, where he was charged with first-degree sexual assault and two counts of risk of injury to a minor.
         Gomez is prohibited from having any contact with the alleged victim, the judge ordered. He is scheduled to appear
         in Litchfield Superior Court on April 7.
