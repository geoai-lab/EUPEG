PRIMARY school youngsters put their culinary skills to the test in a dragon’s den-style competition in Edmonton as part of a healthy eating project aimed at tackling obesity.
Eight schools pitched their food and drink creations to judges at Millfield Theatre, in Silver Street, Edmonton, after taking part in the Cooking Enterprise Project over the summer term.
Paul Everitt, Enfield Council’s head of arts and culture was on the judging panel on Thursday (July 13) along with Emma Rigby, founder of Facebook community group Love Your Doorstep.
First prize was awarded to pupils from Cuckoo Hall Academy, in Cuckoo Hall Lane, who impressed judges with their healthy snack bar.
Runners up were the crunchy munchy team at Galliard primary, in Galliard Road, who made a healthy oat bar.
A fresh Greek salad and a tropical juice sensation won first place in the mini master chef competition created by Raynham Primary pupils, from Raynham Avenue.
Youngsters were educated about healthy food through workshops and were encouraged to use fresh fruit and vegetables in their meals.
After creating their own healthy food and drinks they sold them at their schools with the aim of making a profit.
The project was organised by The Edmonton Community Partnership and run by Kinder Kitchen which provides educational workshops about making healthy food choices.
“The children and teachers enjoy taking part in such a fun initiative,” said Renee Flourentzou, Edmonton Schools Partnership Manager. “It’s a great way to learn about healthy cooking and business at the same time.”
