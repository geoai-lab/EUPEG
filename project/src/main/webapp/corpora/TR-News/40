Spain is hoping to kill off its famed "siesta" naps by moving to a new time zone.
            Labor minister Fátima Báñez has this week revived a proposal to change the country's clocks, saying the move
            would help ensure the working day ended at 6 p.m. and give workers more time with their families.
            It's expected the move would boost worker productivity.
            Spain has flirted with a change for years because the country's clocks don't jive with when the sun rises
            and sets, leading to longer work days.
            Spain's long-time dictator Francisco Franco moved the country's clocks forward an hour to Central European
            Time in the early 1940s to align with Nazi Germany. But the change has stuck for more than 70 years.
            This long-lasting quirk means Spanish workers tend to wake up in the dark, take mid-day siestas -- aka naps
            -- and eat late dinners. Bedtime for Spaniards can be well after midnight -- which means less sleep and lower productivity.
