Claire Lavallee's kids will get a Christmas after all.
            The single mom feared she would not be able to put presents under the tree for her two children after
            getting caught up in the Phoenix pay system fiasco.
            But two days after the public servant's story aired on CBC News, the government agreed to give her nearly
            $1,000 to cover most of the out-of-pocket expenses she racked up while being paid improperly.
            "Everything's going to be great," a relieved Lavallee said in a phone interview. "I'll be able to finish
            buying gifts for my kids this weekend."
            Lavallee first went weeks without pay, and was then underpaid for months, after returning to work from a
            maternity leave in April.
            Despite receiving emergency salary advances, she says it wasn't enough to cover her bills, including her
            mortgage.
            At the same time, Lavallee was in the process of separating from her husband. She had arranged to buy him
            out of his half of the family home,
            but due to the financial instability caused by Phoenix, she says she had to abandon that plan.
            Instead, she sold her family home in Gatineau, Que., and moved with her children to an apartment in Ottawa.
            On Wednesday, Lavallee told CBC News that decision was "absolutely terrible. It was one of the worst things
            I've ever had to do."
            The majority of her pay issues were resolved by September.
