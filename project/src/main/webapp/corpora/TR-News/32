It may be mild out now but prepare for a flash freeze making for slick and slippery driving conditions
            lasting through to Sunday morning.
            A messy mix of freezing drizzle, ice pellets and light snow is expected to descend on Toronto Saturday
            night, Environment Canada warns.
            After a generous dumping of snow Friday night, temperatures climbed up to just above the freezing mark
            Saturday, turning the white stuff to slush in many parts of the city. But the warm up will end in the early
            hours of Sunday morning as the mercury falls to as low as -14 C with a wind chill of -21.
            Salt trucks have been deployed on main roads in Etobicoke, the city said in a tweet and crews expect to
            complete their first round of plowing on sidewalks by 12 a.m.  A second round begins at 2 a.m. and will
            continue throughout Sunday.
            The city is also urging residents not to shovel snow onto roads both to avoid endangering motorists and
            cyclists, and so as not to hamper snow-clearing operations.
