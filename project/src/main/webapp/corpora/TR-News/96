GEORGETOWN, Ky. (WKYT) - Dr. Angela Maggard is an Obstetrician-Gynecologist at Pikeville Medical Women's Care Center. Dr. Maggard is currently in France on what was supposed to be a family trip. Things took a frightening turn on Thursday.
A gunman opened fire on police on Paris' iconic Champs-Elysees boulevard Thursday night. The attack left one officer dead and three people wounded before police shot and killed the attacker. Dr. Maggard was on Champs-Elysees boulevard and witnessed the attack.
"I saw him move it and when he did that, I could see it was a machine gun, and that's when we knew it was a terrorist event. It was an attack," Dr. Maggard described.
Her husband, John Finney said, "He started shooting bullets in the air, and police were in the street. It was a very terrifying moment."
The couple's daughter, Maranda Finney, is in school at Georgetown College. Finney says at first her parents weren't able to provide a lot of details about what was going on, only that they were alive and ok.  She spent the next few hours searching online, trying to find any information she could.
"You don't think it's going to happen to you," Finney said. "I was like it's not going to happen to us. I know it's happened before and everyone thinks that it's not gonna happen. I still can't even fathom."
Finney says she would have been on that trip if not for finals coming up at Georgetown.
Finney's parents and siblings are visiting other cities in Europe as well. They had plans to leave Paris on Saturday. The will return to Kentucky next week.
