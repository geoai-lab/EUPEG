"The Martyred Saint Sebastian" depicts the early Christian saint bound to a tree. This new discovery is the third known da Vinci sketch of the subject.
The artist mentioned eight drawings of the saint in his Codex Atlanticus.
The doctor, whose identity has not been disclosed, brought 14 drawings inherited from his father to Prate's Paris office in March. He'd had the drawings for years, but only after retiring did he resolve to have them valued.
Prate assumes the doctor's father, a book collector, acquired the drawings at a bookstore in the early 20th century, as they had all been mounted on paper mats rather than framed.
Intrigued by the drawing's apparent age, Prate enlisted Patrick de Bayser, an expert in the valuation of Old Masters drawings, to confirm the artist. The paper frame had the name Michelangelo, but the expert doubted that was the artist of this particular drawing.
