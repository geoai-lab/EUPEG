A company Christmas party turned deadly early Sunday with a stabbing that killed a 26-year-old man and left a raft of others in custody, London police say.
Officers were called to an east-end venue, the Imperio Banquet Hall on Falcon Street, shortly after midnight in response to a disturbance. On arrival, police found the victim with stab wounds.
He was taken to hospital by paramedics where he was pronounced dead. No one else was injured in the incident, said London police Const. Kim Flett.
Several people at the scene were arrested and remained in police  custody as of Sunday morning.
The major crimes unit of London police took charge of the investigation and forensic identification officers were on scene as officers combed a snow-covered field next to the banquet hall parking lot.
The business, located in the middle of an industrial area just southwest of the Trafalgar Street-Clarke Road intersection, remained cordoned off by investigators late Sunday.
The Imperio website describes itself as a venue fit for a “wedding, family event, corporate or business function.”
Attempts to reach its owners were unsuccessful Sunday.
It’s unclear which business was holding its Christmas party there at the time of the stabbing. The victim’s name hasn’t yet been made public by police.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call London police at 519-661-5670 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or www.londoncrimestoppers.com.
This death marks the fourth homicide of 2016 in London and the first since September.
