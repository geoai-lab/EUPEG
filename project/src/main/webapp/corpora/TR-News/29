BERLIN — Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal
            of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new
            plan: to copy it.
            Mr. Gentz, a 34-year-old German who is a co-founder of Zalando — a European clone of Zappos,
            the online American shoes and fashion retailer owned by Amazon — held meetings in the fall of
            2013 with Chinese and international fashion labels, online stores and other parts of the local e-commerce
            industry. He wanted to expand his company into the world’s largest digital market.
            But after the meetings, Mr. Gentz decided China’s approach to online fashion was far ahead of anything
            available elsewhere.
            He marveled at how Chinese consumers freely chatted with — and bought from — brands and stylists on WeChat, a local internet messenger, while online retailers, independent delivery companies and fashion houses routinely joined forces.
            “We wanted to take that experience back to Europe,” Mr. Gentz said.
            This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe’s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China
            approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world’s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent’s still-fragmented world of digital fashion.
