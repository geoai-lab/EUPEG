BEIJING --At least two people died and 55 others were injured on Friday in a gas explosion at a noodle restaurant in eastern China, state media reported.
Among those hurt, 12 had sustained serious injuries, Xinhua news agency reported.
The blast took place at around 8:40 a.m. (0040 GMT) at a noodle restaurant in a popular area of Hangzhou, a scenic city in Zhejiang province. Videos of the explosion published by state media show billowing flames and thick, grey smoke enveloping a building.
The flames and the heat shattered the glass of passing vehicles, including a bus, which was what caused most of the injuries, Xinhua reported.
The fire had been put out, authorities said.
Gas explosions and workplace accidents are common in China, where safety regulations are often loosely enforced.
It also comes just a few days after a gas explosion at a curry restaurant in Taichung left one person dead and over a dozen injured.
