Virtually all the housing was built by the company and was rented by the company to its employees. After the sale of the company to Champion Paper in the late 1960s, all the public buildings and housing except those owned by Carter Heirs were sold and moved. The Camden School District was merged into the Corrigan School District with a new name of Corrigan-Camden School District. By the early 1970s all that was left was a post office, Champion company offices and a few vacation homes owned by Carters and DeWalch's. There is a theory that some early Carters were familiar with Camden Maine and that is the origin of the name Camden Texas.
