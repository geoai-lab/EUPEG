Troy is an unincorporated community in Fluvanna County, Virginia, United States. It lies just west of U.S. Route 15, between Zion Crossroads to the north and the county seat of Palmyra to the south. Troy's existence was defined by the Virginia Air Line Railway, which operated from 1908 to 1975. In 1998, the Virginia Department of Corrections opened the Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women in the area. Previously called Clarkland, the location is named after "Captain" T. O. Troy, president of the now-defunct Virginia Air Line Railway. When construction on the rail line to connect Lindsay and Strathmore began in October 1906, the railway stop in Clarkland consisted of little more than a shed. Around May 1908, Troy built a full rail agency station in the community to become the cornerstone of the area's prosperity. The agency shared a building with the town general store, operated by James Hasher. The railroad was completed and began operating in October 1908. However, rail service was reduced to one daily train by 1927 and ended in 1954. The growing adoption of automobiles and airplanes had been taking business away from railroads since the 1930s. On October 26, 1971, the Fluvanna Board of Supervisors unsuccessfully sued the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad to keep the railway in operation; it was abandoned in November 1975. The store was deserted, leaving the graves of the Hasher family next to it.
