Alameda was a city in Bannock County, Idaho, United States. Alameda was established as a village in 1924 at the consolidation of the villages of Fairview and North Pocatello which were platted on the northern boundary of the town of Pocatello in 1911 and 1914 respectively. New commercial and residential development in Alameda occurred in part as a result of its proximity to Pocatello and to a greater degree its location on the Yellowstone Highway (later designated U.S. Route 91), one of Idaho's first designated highways. By 1930 the village exceeded its predessor villages' 1920 population by 144%. In just under 40 years of history, the village became Idaho's 11th most populous City. It was consolidated with Pocatello in 1962 with the support of its mayor, George V. Hansen. Another nearby city, Chubbuck, opposed a similar merger and remained a separate municipality. Among its other businesses, Alameda had four pharmacies: Grand Central Pharmacy (300 block of Jefferson), Poleline Drug (Poleline Road), Alameda Pharmacy (375 Yellowstone) and Hiway Drug (320 Yellowstone).
