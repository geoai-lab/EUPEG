Prospect is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 9,405 at the 2010 census. as of 2013 Robert Chatfield, the longest serving chief elected official in the state, has held the title of mayor in Prospect for 20 terms. In 1967, Prospect switched from first selectman to chief administrative officer, and in 1975, began running under the mayoral form of government. Chatfield, a Republican, was elected to that office on Nov. 7, 1977, and became the second mayor of the town, following George Sabo. Since that time, he has been the only mayor many Prospect residents have known. His most memorable moment in office came when he coined the phrase "The Best Small Town in Connecticut", which has become a favorite among residents. In the late 1990s, Connecticut Magazine named the town one of the worst small towns in the state based on statistics compiled by various agencies. The statement so riled Chatfield, he and several other area chief officials wrote to the magazine supporting Prospect. The day the magazine came out, Chatfield said, he went to a sign company and ordered tags and bumper stickers claiming Prospect as the "Best Small Town in Connecticut". The tags were placed on all town vehicles, and have remained there since.
