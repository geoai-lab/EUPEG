La Libertad (Spanish pronunciation: [la liβerˈtað]) is a municipality in the El Petén department of Guatemala. It contains 79,416 people and has abundant oil reserves that have been commercialized by international oil companies since the 1980s. Concession contract # 2-85 refers to "Xan field" (47 drilled wells), whose exploration started in the mid 1950s. This contract was initially subscribed with the Basic Resources company, founded in the 1960s by John D. Park, one of the lawyers that worked in the Guatemalan Oil Code after the counter-revolution in 1954. Basic Resources started exploring possible oil wells during the 1970s and began the commercial production in the 1980s, in the middle of the Guatemala Civil War. During the 1970s, Basic Resources joins "Operación Conjunta", which is a combined effort led by the French public company Elf Aquitaine. By 1993, Basic Resources had a refinery setup in La Libertad, and an oil pipeline all the way to the Xan wells in Laguna del Tigre. In 1985, Basic Resources had signed contract 2-85 with the Guatemalan government for 25 years. However, in the mid 1990s, the new environmental laws and civilian groups start complaining that there is negative impacts from the oil activity in Laguna del Tigre. Basic Resources tries to calm the protests by creating environmental and conscience projects, but it is unable to do so.
