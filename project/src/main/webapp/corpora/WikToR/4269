Sal is a concelho (municipality) of Cape Verde. It covers the whole island of Sal. Its capital is the town Espargos. The municipality consists of one freguesia (civil parish), Nossa Senhora das Dores, which also covers the whole island. The freguesia is subdivided into the following settlements: Espargos Murdeira Palmeira Pedra de Lume Santa Maria Terra Boa Sal’s main town, Espargos, is home to one of the nation’s international airports and has around 17,000 inhabitants. Sal's population grew around salt collection and later shifted to fishing, but is now based on tourism (amounting to 50% of the archipelago’s tourism) at the beach resort of Santa Maria. Its airport, Amílcar Cabral International Airport, was used as a refuelling base by South African Airways on its Johannesburg to London routes. Later, flights to and from New York and Atlanta also refuelled there, and the island was a crew-change station. SAA established the long runways needed by the fully fueled Boeing 707s on their take-offs in the high temperatures. On July 1, 2006, SAA operated its final flight to Sal due to the ending of its flights to Atlanta.
