The pioneers knew of the place along the stream where the barrel rims could be found. Little by little the place became known as "Córrego dos Arcos", Stream of the Barrel Rims. However the city only received the name in 1833. Before it had been called São Julião. Today this name belongs to a rural community of the municipality which has the chapel of São Julião.
