Davenport is a village in Thayer County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 294 at the 2010 census. In 1872, the village was platted by the Nebraska Land and Town Company, and the St. Joseph and Denver City railroad line (later taken over by Union Pacific) was built through the site of village. It was named after Davenport, Iowa. In 1887, the village was officially incorporated. In 1888, North Western Railroad also built a line through the village. Two railroad lines with passenger and freight service brought much business to the village and helped support several hotels. The public school was established in 1877.
