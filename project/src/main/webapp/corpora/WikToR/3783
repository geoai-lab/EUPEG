In the 1970s, Gordon Dutt, Ph.D., a soil scientist from the University of Arizona, was intrigued with the similarity between the soil of the Elgin-Sonoita area and that of Burgundy, France. In partnership with A. Blake Brophy, he developed an experimental winery that later developed into the Sonoita Vineyards and that encouraged other vineyards in the area. Presently, growers in the area produce Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Mission, and Syrah grapes. There are presently (2009) nine vineyards in the region, producing about 50,000 gallons of wine yearly.
