Mau, now known as Maunath Bhanjan, is an industrial town in Uttar Pradesh, India, located nearly 120 km from Varanasi on the banks of Tamsa (Choti Saryu). It is a major centre of the textile weavers. It is divided into 4 tehsils, 9 blocks, 596 gram panchayats and 1644 villages. The Tamasa river flows through the city. In the 1960s it was the biggest supplier of a plant called plash. This town is the headquarters of the Mau district. Many myths are popular regarding the history of Mau district. The word 'Mau' means 'padaav' or 'chhavani' in Turkish language i.e. barrack. The city was used as barracks by many rulers since long ago. Shershah Suri, Akbar, Aurangzeb are the prominent rulers who used the city in such a way. There is a mosque, built by Aurangzaib's sister Jahan Aara Beghum, the shahi mosque attached with a number of barracks (can be seen still now) in mohalla keyari tola. It is also believed by the People of Mau that centuries before lived a man (a natt), a dancer named 'Muhoo Natt Bhajjan', who was cruel in nature. He always use to tease people the entire area therefore, a Holy man (Malik tahir baba, who was the chief of the area) asked him to leave that area, for the sake of his people, to which he replied negatively. Then the malik tahir baba challenged him to wrestle and win. If he wins, Malik tahir baba will leave the area else he himself will. After the wrestle the Malik tahir baba won. He asked the natt to leave the place at once. He agreed and kept his condition to leave. He asked the Malik tahir baba to keep the name of his area on his (Natt's) name. Malik tahir baba agreed and gave the name of his area 'Muhoo Natt Bhajjan'. This named was further modified to 'Maunath Bhanjan'.
