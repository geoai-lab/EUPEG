Clinton is a town in Vernon County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 1,354 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Bloomingdale is located partially within the town. The town was named for New York Governor DeWitt Clinton. Recently a movement called "Save Taryn's Beaver" was launched to save a family of beavers on upper Weister Creek. The beaver is a keystone species, increasing trout and bird biodiversity in its territory through creation of beaver ponds and wetlands. Options to manage the problem include beaver relocation, killing or installation of Flow devices to regulate pond height. The town of Clinton, Wisconsin is holding hearings to decide the fate of the Weister Creek beavers on May 12, 2010. At the first hearing, May 12, 70 citizens showed up and it was standing room only in a debate between those who wanted to protect the beavers versus those who feared further road damage or loss of pastureland to wetland. Bill Quackenbush, a representative of the Ho Chunk Tribal Nation, suggested that the Vernon County Board, which recently was awarded $1.2 million in funds from the Ho Chunk Nation to use on county projects, help defray the cost of installation of fencing and flow devices to lower the height of the beaver dam and protect Dell Road. The next hearing will be May 26.
