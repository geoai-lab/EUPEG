Hastings is an unincorporated community in Wetzel County, West Virginia, United States. It lies at an elevation of 755 feet (230 m). I Hastings was established as a company town by the Hope Natural Gas Company in the early part of the 20th century. With a population of several hundred people who lived in as many as fifty company houses, the community also had a church, a school, a company store, an athletic field, a post office, and a community hall. The community had indoor athletic facilities for basketball, table tennis and billiards, and it also served as a theater. A hotel in the community was used by company employees who traveled to the site to perform maintenance and other tasks. Hastings was named for Dennis Hastings, the first superintendent of the original natural gas processing plant on site. It was a thriving community into the late 1960s when they baby boomers began to graduate from high school and their parents and grandparents began retiring and moving away. Nowadays it is a virtual ghost town with only two company houses remaining.
