Collinsville is a mining town and locality in the Whitsunday Region, Queensland, Australia. In the 2011 census, Collinsville had a population of 1,501 people. The town has a historical association with radicalism to the extent that it earned the nickname "little Moscow". Collinsville is in the coal-rich Bowen Basin region of Central Queensland, 1,245 kilometres (774 mi) north of Brisbane and 87 kilometres (54 mi) south-west of the coastal town of Bowen. European settlement of the region began in 1861 with the opening of the lands to pastoralists, with some cattle stations still in operation. Coal was discovered in 1866 but it wasn't until 1912 that large-scale mining operations commenced. The town was originally known as 'Moongunya', an aboriginal word that roughly translates to 'place of coal'. On 20 September 1921 it was officially renamed Collinsville after Charles Collins who was the Labor Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Bowen from 1915 to 1936. Collinsville State School opened on 27 June 1921. Collinsville Post Office opened on 21 May 1923 (a receiving office had been open from 1922).
