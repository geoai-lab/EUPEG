Rogers is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 8,597 at the 2010 census. However, the population increased to over 11,000 upon the annexing of surrounding Hassan Township in 2012. The population of Hassan Township was 2,600 in 2010, giving the current city a population base of 11,197 as of the census. The center of population of Minnesota is located in Rogers [1]. The city is a northwest suburb of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. Located on either side of Interstate 94, with Minnesota State Highway 101 running north, Rogers has been teeming with growth for the past 20 years. The 2000-2010 (8,597) population growth rate was +139.6%. In the 1880s, John Rogers sold an acre of his land, then part of Hassan Township, to Great Northern Railroad for a dollar. The new depot provided a convenient stop for the rich timber resources of the area, and served as the beginning ground of a new community. When St. Martin Catholic Church and school were added, Rogers grew in local importance, consequently causing new businesses to be built and the town to be regarded as more of a local hub than other nearby communities such as Fletcher. In 1914, the city was incorporated.
