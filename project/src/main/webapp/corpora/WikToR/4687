Alberton is a locality in the City of Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. According to the 2011 census it had a population of 576. It is bounded in the north by the Logan River and in the west by its tributary, the Albert River. The Aboriginal name for the area was Wobbomerijee (where Wobum means mud and Mudtheri means sticky). European settlement began in 1863 when the first settlers arrived, mostly German immigrants. A town reserve was established in 1865 on the souther bank near the junction of the Logan and Albert Rivers. In 1869, the first Lutheran church was established near the Lutheran cemetery on Zipfs Road. The area was known as Elkana (meaning "God has created and blessed"). Later the area was called Alberton after Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, but the name Elkana is preserved in Elkana Road. In 1870, a ferry service across the river was introduced with the first bridge being built in 1876 at Yatala. A German school was established early in the 1870s beside the church. The Alberton Provisional School opened on 13 May 1876 with children attending German school on only one day a week. On 13 October 1884 the provisional school became the Alberton State School. In 1886, a new larger Lutheran church (the present St Peter's at 187 Alberton Road) was built. It was consecrated in 1887 by Rev Hellmuth.
