Strand is a district in Bærum, Norway. Mainly a residential area, it is also known as a marine recreational site, owing to its proximity to the Oslofjord. The district is located west of Stabekk and Fornebulandet and east of Høvik. To the south is Holtekilen, an arm of the Oslofjord. It has its name from the cotter's farm Strandbakken, which for many years belonged to the farm Store Stabekk. In 1886 Strandbakken was bought by barrister Henrik Homan, who built a villa there. The villa was bought by Bærum municipality in 1924, and became the well-known Strand Restaurant. The surrounding area was developed into a park (Strandparken) and a small boat harbor. Strand Restaurant is currently administered by the sailing club Bærum SF. Boat traffic to nearby islands was discontinued in the 1960s. The canoeing club Strand KK, founded 1936, has its name from the district, but today their base is at Høvik. A small tennis club founded in 1975, Strand TK, is based in Strandparken. The area north of Strand Restaurant was parcelled out in the early twentieth century, and was mostly built with villas. At eastern Strand, near Holtet farm, the Stabekk river emptied into Holtekilen. Today, most of the Stabekk Watershed has been led underground through a pipe system, and the waterway is no longer visible. In the early 2000s the district has been subject a number of controversial building cases.
