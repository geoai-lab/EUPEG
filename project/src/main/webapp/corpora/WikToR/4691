Ryabovo (Russian: Рябово) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in Tosnensky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located southeast of Saint Petersburg, between the towns of Tosno and Lyuban. Municipally it is incorporated as Ryabovskoye Urban Settlement, one of the seven urban settlements in the district. Population: 3,251 (2010 Census); 3,309 (2002 Census); 3,935 (1989 Census). In 1907, Esmeralda Mende (Russian: Эсмеральда Яковлевна Менде), a British citizen, bought a piece of land in Ryabovo and built a brick factory, which started operation in 1910. Prior to these events, Ryabovo was a summer house area. It was a part of Lyubanskaya Volost of Novgorodsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. On 1 August 1927 the uyezds were abolished and Lyubansky District, with the administrative center in the town of Lyuban, was established. Ryabovo became a part of Lyubansky District. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On 23 July 1930 the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On 19 August 1930 Lyubansky District was abolished and Ryabovo became a part of newly established Tosnensky District with the administrative district in the town of Tosno. Between September 1941 and January 1944, during World War II, it was occupied by German troops. On 3 November 1965 Ryabovo was granted urban-type settlement status.
