Bethany is a city in and the county seat of Harrison County, Missouri, United States. The population was 3,292 at the 2010 census. The settlement of Harrison County began around 1838, although the land was not surveyed and opened for entry until 1842. The county is named after Albert C. Harrison, a 19th-century Missouri political figure. Many of the early settlers to the area homesteaded along Sugar Creek and in the Bethany area. Three commissioners deliberated for several days to determine a site for the county seat, and voted to site it in the southern part of the county. The original name of the community was Dallas. In June 1845, John S. Allen was appointed to survey the town into lots and offer the same for sale. The plat, covering 19 acres (7.7 hectare), was completed on 27 June 1845. The name Dallas apparently did not meet with the general approval of the residents of the community and the issue was brought before the county court. It was decided that the court and county officials present would select a new name by ballot. The names of Bethany and Carthage were proposed. The vote favored "Bethany"; accordingly the town's name was changed. It was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly dated 6 January 1860. The first mayor was T.H. Templeman.
