Ocampo is a 3rd class municipality in the province of Camarines Sur, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 43,523 people. Historical documents revealed that the municipality of Ocampo, known before as Mabato-bato, was existing since 1735. Mabato-bato started as a sitio which was described as abounding with rocks and boulders of various sizes which were scattered over the place. Since the early 1900s, the town of Ocampo had been a part of Pili though it separated years later, in 1949, and became an independent municipality. August 13, 1949, marked a major event in the history of the town as this was the inauguration date of Ocampo's elevation into a municipality. It was also during this day when the name Matobato was officially changed into Ocampo, in honor of the late Don Julian Ocampo, then the governor of Camarines Sur. Ocampo is the place where Governor Luis Villafuerte chose to build a sprawling deer sanctuary where at present houses different deer species from both local and foreign origins. This has served both for tourist attraction and commercial purposes.
