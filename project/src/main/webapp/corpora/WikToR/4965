Oneida County is a county located in the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2010 Census the county had a population of 4,286. The county seat and largest city is Malad City. Most of the county's population lives in Malad City and the surrounding Malad Valley. The county is named for Oneida Lake, New York, the area from which most of the early settlers had emigrated. Oneida County was organized on January 22, 1864, as the second county organized under Idaho Territory. Its original boundaries were set at the 113th meridian, the Snake River, the 112th Meridian north of the Snake River, the Rocky Mountains, and the southern boundary of Idaho Territory. While older and more populous settlements existed within the boundaries of the new county, the original county seat was established at Soda Springs in present-day Caribou County because those older settlements were believed to be in Utah Territory until the southern boundary of Idaho Territory was surveyed in 1870. The county seat was moved to Malad City in 1866 because of its population growth and location on the freight road and stagecoach line between Corinne, Utah, and the mines in Butte, Montana.
