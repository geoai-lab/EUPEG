Douma (Arabic: دوما‎ Dūmā) is a city in Syria. Its centre is about 10 km (6 mi) north-east of the centre of Damascus. Being the centre of Rif Dimashq governorate (which completely surrounds the Damascus Governorate), the town is also the administrative centre of Douma District. During the Syrian Civil War, Douma has been a major flashpoint and had witnessed numerous demonstrations against the Syrian government and armed clashes against the Syrian Army and Security forces during the early stages of the conflict. On 30 January 2012, the Syrian Army gained control over the city after the Battle of Douma, a major operation against the opposition armed groups in Rif Dimashq Governorate. On 29 June 2012, Syrian Army is accused of committing a massacre in Douma, where more than 50 people where killed. As of 18 October 2012, the Free Syrian Army was in control of most of the suburb. Fighting and bombardments continue in the town. In the 2015 Douma market massacre, the city was attacked by Syrian Army ground-to-ground missiles, leaving at least 50 dead and several more missing.
