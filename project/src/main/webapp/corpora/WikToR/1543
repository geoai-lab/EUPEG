Elizabeth was an incorporated municipality in central Cobb County, Georgia, that existed de jure from 1885 to 1995. Originally incorporated by an act of the Georgia General Assembly on October 5, 1885, as the town of Elizabeth, it never began functioning as a municipality; in particular, no historical evidence exists that the town held any elections for mayor and the city council. In a new law passed in 1964, the General Assembly renamed the town as the City of Elizabeth, and on October 6 of that year the residents voted 3 to 1 in an election to approve the city's charter, yet still never elected a mayor or city council. Finally, in 1995, the city's charter was revoked along with dozens of others, pursuant to a 1994 law requiring that cities provide at least three services from a list defined in the law. The town's initial boundary was defined in the 1885 incorporating act as a radius of one-half mile from the center of the engine house of the American Marble Cutting Company. The 1964 law specified the city's boundary as "onehalf mile from the center of the engine house of Frank G. North Chemical Company in Cobb County, Georgia, being the same point as the center of the engine house of the former American Marble Cutting Company, i.e., said corporate limits shall commence at the center thereof and extend one-half mile north, south, east and west in a circular fashion so as to include all the territories in all directions within one-half mile of the center of said engine house."
